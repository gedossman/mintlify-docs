description: "Interf provides the open protocol and gateway infrastructure for agent self-onboarding. Onboarding-as-Code — requirements declared in a machine-readable contract, resolved before implementation begins."
---

**Interf** provides the open **Agent Onboarding Protocol (AOP)** and **Shared Context Gateway** for agent self-onboarding in enterprise environments.

We treat **Onboarding-as-Code**: requirements are declared in a machine-readable contract, then resolved against the enterprise environment to produce a deterministic readiness state.

## The Problem: Blind Agents

Agents are designed to be autonomous, but today they deploy blindly into opaque enterprise environments. They don't know if they have the necessary **Data Access**, **Authentication**, or **Compliance** permissions to function.

This leads to **readiness gaps discovered mid-flight** — stalled deployments, frozen capital, and implementation delays.

## The Solution: Protocol + Gateway

Interf sits between **Agent Capabilities** and **Enterprise Context**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent Onboarding Protocol (AOP)" icon="code">
    Open standard for declaring agent requirements (data, auth, compliance) as a **Capability Contract** in `interf.yaml`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared Context Gateway (MCP Server)" icon="server">
    Resolves contracts against the enterprise environment. Exposes **MCP endpoint** for agents to query readiness and self-onboard.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Mechanism

1. **Define:** Vendors define requirements in an `interf.yaml` contract.
2. **Resolve:** Enterprise prepares dependencies. Gateway tracks resolution.
3. **Onboard:** Agent connects via **MCP**, checks readiness, proceeds when ready.

```yaml
# interf.yaml
gateway: "0.1.3"

contract:
  name: "Workplace Scenario Modeling"
  author: "GATHR Workplace"
  version: "1.4.0"

schemas:
  interf: "@interf/schema@0.1.0"

dependencies:
  required:
    - ref: interf.real_estate.lease_portfolio
    - ref: interf.hr.headcount_data

    - id: space_utilization
      title: "Space Utilization"
      description: "Desk usage, attendance patterns"
      owner: "COO / Head of Workplace"

  optional:
    - ref: interf.finance.occupancy_costs

    - id: budget_constraints
