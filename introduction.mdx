**Interf** provides the open **Capabilities Protocol** and **Runtime** infrastructure to solve the **Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) Crisis**.

We treat **Agent Onboarding as Code**: requirements are declared in a machine-readable contract, then evaluated against the enterprise environment to produce a deterministic readiness state.

## The Problem: Blind Agents

Agents are designed to be autonomous, but today they are deployed "blindly" into opaque enterprise environments. They do not know if they have the necessary **Data Access**, **Authentication**, or **Compliance** permissions to function.

This leads to a structural failure where **readiness gaps are discovered mid-flight**. Organizations are forced to rely on human FDEs to manually patch these gaps, causing massive stalls and frozen capital.

## The Solution: Protocol + Runtime

Interf sits between **Agent Logic** and **Enterprise Context**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Protocol" icon="code">
    **Agentic Capabilities Protocol (ACP)**
    A machine-readable standard for declaring Agent requirements (data, auth, compliance) as a **Capabilities Contract**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Runtime" icon="server">
    **Interf Runtime (MCP Server)**
    Infrastructure that evaluates the contract against the enterprise environment and exposes a **readiness state** that agents can query to self-onboard.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Mechanism

1.  **Declare:** Vendors define requirements in a `capabilities.yaml` contract.
2.  **Evaluate:** The **Interf Runtime** checks the contract against local resources (Data, Auth, Rules).
3.  **Onboard:** The Agent connects via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to discover its state and self-onboard.

```yaml
# capabilities.yaml (The Contract)
agent: "financial_analyst_agent"
version: "0.1.0"

capabilities:
  - id: "ledger_write_access"
    description: "Allows agent to update Q4 forecasts"
    prerequisites:
      - type: "data"
        resource: "snowflake_finance"
        access: "write"
      - type: "compliance"
        standard: "soc2_type_ii"
```

<Note>
  **Status:** The Protocol Specification and Runtime (v0.1) will be published here in **January 2026**.
