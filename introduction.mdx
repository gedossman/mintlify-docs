**Interf** provides the open **Agent Readiness Protocol** and **Agent Readiness Gateway** for enterprise environments.

We treat **Readiness-as-Code**: requirements are declared in a machine-readable `interf.yaml` manifest, then simulated against real enterprise profiles to surface every dependency, stakeholder, and timeline — before a single line of integration code is written.

## Quick Start

Install the MCP server and connect it to Claude Code in one command:

```bash
claude mcp add interf-gateway -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... -- npx -y @interf/gateway
```

Then in any project:

```
> Use interf to generate an agent readiness spec for this project
> Run a simulation for a Fortune 500 bank
```

That's it. The agent generates your `interf.yaml`, runs an LLM-powered simulation, and saves results to `.interf/simulations/`.

## The Problem: Blind Agents

Agents are designed to be autonomous, but today they deploy blindly into opaque enterprise environments. They don't know if they have the necessary **Data Access**, **Authentication**, or **Compliance** permissions to function.

This leads to **readiness gaps discovered mid-flight** — stalled deployments, frozen capital, and implementation delays.

## The Solution: Protocol + Gateway

Interf sits between **Agent Capabilities** and **Enterprise Context**.

## How It Works

1. **Generate:** Agent calls `get_protocol_guidance`, learns the spec, analyzes your project, and writes an `interf.yaml`.
2. **Simulate:** Agent calls `run_simulation` with your manifest and target enterprise profiles (e.g. "Fortune 500 bank", "Series B fintech").
3. **Resolve:** Each dependency gets a full resolution flow — steps, owners, timelines, risks, and mitigations.

```yaml
# interf.yaml
name: crm-automation-agent
version: 0.1.0
description: Automates CRM data entry and follow-up scheduling

dependencies:
  - type: api
    name: Salesforce API
    description: Read/write contacts and opportunities
    required: true
    config:
      endpoint: https://api.salesforce.com
      auth_type: oauth2
      scopes: [api, refresh_token]

  - type: auth

    required: true
    config:

  - type: approval
    name: Security Review
    description: InfoSec team must approve API access
    required: true
    config:
      approver_role: security_engineer
      justification: Agent accesses customer PII via Salesforce

capabilities:
  - read_contacts
  - write_contacts
  - read_opportunities
  - schedule_followups

risk_level: high
```

## Simulation Output

Each simulation returns structured, per-dependency analysis:

- **Resolution flow** — ordered steps with owners, timelines, and blockers
- **Stakeholders** — roles, involvement level, time commitment
- **Risks** — likelihood, impact, and mitigations
- **Critical path** — total days to production readiness

Results are saved to `.interf/simulations/` for visualization and tracking.
